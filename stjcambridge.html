        <h2>History of St. John Vianney Cambridge Illinois</h2>
        <p>By Mary Ellen Horton and Norma Sands<BR><BR>

            The year was 1963. The time had come when area Catholics were becoming more and more convinced of a definite need for a parish and church in the Cambridge community.<BR><BR>
            
            A survey was taken by Francis Langheim to see if it would be feasible to have a Mission Church. He found potential Parishioners attending Mass in several surrounding towns. Most everyone he contacted was enthusiastic and encouraging concerning the forming of a new parish. Their dream might become a reality… there was hope.<BR><BR>
            
            Bishop John B. Franz of the Peoria Diocese was contacted concerning the hope of the Cambridge area Catholics to form a Parish. On December 31, 1963, Bishop Franz wrote Rev. George M. Herbach, Pastor of St. Malachy’s Parish in Geneseo, of his interest in forming a new Parish in Cambridge, Illinois. On March 13, 1964, Father Herbach was officially appointed the first Pastor of the new Mission, to be known as St. John Vianney Parish.<BR><BR>
            
            People came from all around to attend the first mass in the humble surroundings of the rented American Legion Hall in Cambridge on Sunday, May 17, 1964. These people were from many walks of life, from farmer to factory worker. It was with pleasure and pride they offered Mass that day with father Herbach and with Joseph and James Moriarity as Altar Boys.<BR><BR>
            
            Father Herbach soon found all his duties at St. Malachy’s and St. John’s quite demanding. Father John O’Connor, of Alleman High School in Rock Island, became the Assistant Pastor in 1964 to help Father Herbach meet the needs of the Parishioners. Father O’Connor brought much faith, idealism, and good spirit to the people of the parish until his transfer in 1967. His generosity and faithfulness were appreciated by all who worked with him.<BR><BR>
            
            Mr. Francis Langheim and Mr. Peter DeBoever were appointed Trustees for St. John Vianney Parish. Mr. August Boelens replaced Francis Langheim in 1966 when he moved from the community.<BR><BR></p>
