        <h2>History of St. John Evangelist Galva Illinois</h2>
        <p>Early pioneers came to the Galva area in 1853 and, after a few years, formed the town of Galva in 1857. During those four years area Catholics were only able to attend Mass in Kewanee. The first Masses in Galva were said in 1857-1858 in private homes by a priest from Lacon, Illinois by the name of Rev. Kilkenny.   After a few years this arrangement could not be continued and Galva Catholics once again attended Mass in Kewanee.<br><br>

            With the inspiration of two priests in Kewanee, Galva Catholics could again attend Mass in Galva. Father John Murray Ryan and Father John F. Ryan began offering services by riding horseback from town to town. Masses in Galva were held in the private home of Phil Costello. Ironically, Costello’s home was located one block north of the present day St. John’s Church. This arrangement continued until 1882. By that time, twenty-fine (25) Catholic families lived in Galva and the immediate surrounding area and these families decided to build their own church.<br><br>
            
            In the summer of 1882 a contract was awarded to H. I. Dickinson of Galva and work officially began on the new church. The church was a structure of 30’ x 61’ and, in early 1883 and at a cost of a little over $3,000, the first St. John’s Church was completed. Most of the funds were provided by the parishioners; however, a benefit dance was held to raise the final $400 needed for completion. Olaf Krans, a Swedish descendent and original member of the early Bishop Hill Colony, did the interior decorations of the church.   Finally, on April 5, 1883, the consecration service was held and Galva had its first Catholic Church. Various priests from Kewanee served Mass in the new church, as St. John’s was officially a Mission of Kewanee.<br><br>
            
            In 1888, Fr. James Heaney helped raise $2,300 and began the construction of a rectory next to the church. It was built 77’ from the church and was to be a two-story structure of 35’ x 47’. Once completed, Fr. Heaney was appointed the first resident pastor of Galva, with missions of Woodhull, Wataga, and later Toulon. Mass was said in each community once a month. This rectory still stands today.<br><br>
            
            By 1890, church membership had grown to about 40 families and in 1892 the church was extensively remodeled. A service of re-dedication was held that May. Mass continued to be said one Sunday a month until the early 1900’s when Mass was offered at Galva and Toulon one Sunday and the following Sunday at Woodhull and Wataga. The pastor would go to his missions on Saturday and remain in the homes of parishioners overnight. The pastor could use the train to go between Woodhull and Galva; but, he had to use the buggy to make Wataga and Toulon. During the pastorate of Rev. William Graham (1917-1926) the Missions were given Mass every Sunday because Fr. Graham was the first pastor to own a car. After a few years, Toulon ceased to be a mission of Galva and in 1946, Wataga became a mission of Alexis. Woodhull continued as a mission of Galva until June 8, 1966, when it received its own pastor.<br><br>
            
            By 1944 additional space was needed and it was provided by digging out a basement under the existing church. This area saw many uses including as meeting space for various church organizations, a location for religious instruction, and a place for social gatherings. While this helped address the growing space needs of the parish, it wouldn’t last for long. By 1959 the original church (which had a seating capacity of approximately 120 people) was bulging at the seams as the parish had grown to 105 families. The need for more space was obvious. Thus on July 20, 1959 a formal building fund drive was initiated under the pastorship of Rev. C. Jagodzinski.<br><br>
            
            Initially the rectory was extensively remodeled and modernized. Electrical wiring and utilities were brought up to current day standards and the living quarters were updated. Efforts to develop a comprehensive plan to improve the church continued and in 1965 neighboring property was purchased in anticipation of construction of a new church. On April 15, 1967 construction contracts were signed for the building of a new church and nine days later, the “old” church was taken down so that a new one could be built.<br><br>
            
            On June 8, 1967, ground was broken for the new St. John’s Church. According to the design approved by the Building Committee, the Church was to be an octagon shape with 88’ across the center. The building would contain both a Church and a Hall. The Church would be 5,127 sq. ft. and the Hall would be 1,972 sq. ft. or a total of 7,099 sq. ft. In addition, there would be 695 sq. ft. at the basement level for a furnace area and an overhang area of 1,189 sq. ft. Finally, the Committee design allowed for an addition of 1,903 sq. ft. at some point in the future. The cost of the basic building was $123,258.94 and for the furnishings and all other items in the Church and Hall an additional $23,691.75. Thus, the new St. John’s Church cost a total of $147,220.69. Its seating capacity is 400. Its interior walls are cinder block and the exterior is Montezuma Blend brick. The roof is constructed of laminated beams with cedar wood decking. The floors are concreate covered with carpet in the church and tile in the hall. The furnace uses natural gas and, while the original design did not include air conditioning, it since has been added.<br><br>
            
            Mass in the new St. John’s was first held on July 21, 1968. The cornerstone of the new church was blessed and set in place by Pastor Gerard Verhoye on April 6, 1969. St. John – 1967 was engraved on the stone. A stainless steel box was placed in the church well behind the cornerstone and, in it, was placed a complete history of the St. John’s Parish. The new church was dedicated by the Most Reverend John B. Franz, D.D., Bishop of Peoria, during Mass on April 20, 1969.</p>
